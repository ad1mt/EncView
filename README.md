Encview v5.02
==============
This is my own personal password manager.

If you stumble across this program, use it at your own risk!

No documentation, no license (public domain), no guarantee.

It works like a very basic text editor, except that all files are encrypted using a proprietary encryption algorithm.
Yes, I know you are not supposed to design your own encryption algorithm, but by doing this, I can guarantee that
there are no hidden backdoors that will allow unwanted decryption.

Written using the Free Pascal compiler. Explanation of the encryption algorithm available on request.

The latest version has bug fixes; if you are using this program, you are recommened to upgrade. 
However, you MUST decrypt your file using the previous version into a plain test file, then re-encrypt using the
latest version.

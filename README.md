Encview v3.00
==============
This is Mark Taylor's personal password manager.

If you stumble across this program, use it at your own risk!

No documentation, no guarantee, no license (public domain).

It works like a very basic text editor, except that all files are encrypted using a proprietary encryption algorithm.
Yes, I know you are not supposed to design your own encryption algorithm, but by doing this, I can guarantee that
there are no hidden backdoors that will allow unwanted decryption.

Written using the Free Pascal compiler. Source code and/or explanation of the encryption algorithm available on request.

The latest version has bug fixes; if you are using this program, you are recommened to upgrade. 
However, you MUST decrypt your file using the previous version v2.12 into a plain test file, then re-encrypt using the
latest version.
